# Constructible Trait {#examples-core-reflection-traits-constructible}

@brief Exposing the destructor and constructors of a type.

You may find it useful while working with type-erased data to be able to create
copies of the data, destroy it, or move it around. The
@ref cubos::core::reflection::ConstructibleTrait "ConstructibleTrait" trait
exposes the size, alignment, destructor and constructors of a type.

Lets say you have a type `Scale`, which you want to be able to reflect, with a
default value of `1.0`:

@snippet reflection/traits/constructible/main.cpp Scale declaration

We're going to add the @ref cubos::core::reflection::ConstructibleTrait
"ConstructibleTrait" trait to it, so that we can create instances of it at
runtime:

@snippet reflection/traits/constructible/main.cpp Scale definition

Now, we can access the trait from the reflected type:

@snippet reflection/traits/constructible/main.cpp Accessing the trait

Imagine for a moment that you don't know the type of the data you're working,
and you only have access to its reflection data through `scaleType`. If you
want to create a default instance of the type, you can call the default
constructor stored in the trait:

@snippet reflection/traits/constructible/main.cpp Creating a default instance

Don't forget to destroy the instance manually when you're done with it:

@snippet reflection/traits/constructible/main.cpp Destroying the instance
