## Voxel based engine

**Cubos aims to be a simple, but powerful game engine for PC, where**
**everything is made out of voxels.**

It is open source and free to use for any purpose. Written in modern *C++* (20)
and with data-oriented design in mind, its goal is to be both performant and
highly flexible.
