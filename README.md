## Voxel based engine

**CUBOS. aims to be a simple, but powerful game engine for PC, where**
**everything is made out of voxels.**

It is open source and free to use for any purpose. Written in *C++* and with
data-oriented design in mind, its goal is to be both performant and highly
flexible.

Check out the project's [website](https://gamedevtecnico.github.io/cubos) which
contains the documentation, guides and examples on how to use the engine.

### Who is making this engine

**CUBOS.** is developed by a small team at
[GameDev Técnico](https://www.instagram.com/gamedevtecnico/), a student group
at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) who make games.
Our goal is to build a game engine from the ground up and have fun doing it.
