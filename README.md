## Voxel based engine

**CUBOS. aims to be a simple, but powerful engine for PC, where everything is**
**made out of voxels.**

It aims to support vast render distances and destructibility, which sets it
apart from other engines. Written in *C++*, built with *OpenGL*, it's a
high-performance engine.

## Structure

The source code is divided into four main parts:
- `core`: library which is shared between the tools and the games. This
includes some basic functionality like serialization, logging, render devices,
input handling and others.
- `engine`: library with code exclusive to the game execution. This includes
the main loop, the asset manager and systems like the renderer and physics.
- `cubinhos`: a tool which helps you with the game development and which
may depend on `core`. One example use case of `cubinhos` is convert from
external voxel formats to the internal format used by **CUBOS.**.
- `tesserato`: game editor made on top of multiple plugins, that can also be used individually 
in your game using **CUBOS.**.

### Further reading

You can find more information about how the engine is structured in the
[documentation](https://gamedevtecnico.github.io/cubos/).

## Getting the engine

### Executables

There are no releases of **CUBOS.** so far. We will update this section once
we release official binaries.
<!--Official binaries for **CUBOS.** can be found
on the [releases](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos/releases) page.-->

### Building from the source code

#### Dependencies

The following dependencies are used to compile **CUBOS.**:

| Name                                               | Importance         | Submodule Path        | Installed Separately |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| [CMake](https://cmake.org/)                        | Essential          | -                     | Yes                  |
| [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)           | Essential          | -                     | No                   |
| [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)            | Essential          | -                     | No                   |
| [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)               | Essential          | `core/lib/glfw`       | Optionally           |
| [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)               | Essential          | `core/lib/glm`        | Optionally           |
| [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)               | Essential          | `core/lib/fmt`        | Optionally           |
| [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)         | Essential          | `core/lib/spdlog`     | Optionally           |
| [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)     | Essential          | `core/lib/yaml-cpp`   | Optionally           |
| [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) | Required for tests | `core/lib/googletest` | Optionally           |

Dependencies marked as *Essential* are required to compile the engine.
**CUBOS.** uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as its build system, so you must
install it to compile the engine.

Most dependencies come as submodules, so, you may choose whether to install
them separately or not. If you choose to install some or all of them
separately, you can do so easily by using the package manager of your choice.
If you use Windows, it should be easier to simply install all of them with the
engine by cloning the whole repository with the `--recursive` flag.

#### Compiling

If you chose to install some dependencies separately, you must pass the
corresponding `-D` flag to CMake. For example, if you installed GLFW, GLM and
CMake separetely you would pass the following flags to CMake:

`cmake -H. -Bbuild -DGLFW_USE_SUBMODULE=OFF -DGLM_USE_SUBMODULE=OFF -DYAMLCPP_USE_SUBMODULE=OFF`

The following is a list of all the options available to configure the engine:

| Name                       | Description                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `WITH_GLFW`                | Use GLFW? (Required for now)       |
| `WITH_OPENGL`              | Use OpenGL? (Required for now)     |
| `GLFW_USE_SUBMODULE`       | Compile glfw from source?          |
| `GLM_USE_SUBMODULE`        | Compile glm from source?           |
| `YAMLCPP_USE_SUBMODULE`    | Compile yaml-cpp from source?      |
| `GOOGLETEST_USE_SUBMODULE` | Compile GoogleTest from source?    |
| `SPDLOG_USE_SUBMODULE`     | Compile spdlog from source?        |
| `FMT_USE_SUBMODULE`        | Compile fmt from source?           |
| `BUILD_CORE_SAMPLES`       | Build **CUBOS.** `core` samples?   |
| `BUILD_CORE_TESTS`         | Build **CUBOS.** `core` tests?     |
| `BUILD_ENGINE_SAMPLES`     | Build **CUBOS.** `engine` samples? |

### Samples

Both the `core` and the `engine` contain samples that you can run to get an
idea of how the engine works.

### Testing

**CUBOS.** uses GoogleTest for unit testing the engine.
To test the engine's core you can use the following
command: `cd build/core && ctest`.
