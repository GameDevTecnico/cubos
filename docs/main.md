## Voxel based engine

**CUBOS. aims to be a simple, but powerful engine for PC, where everything is**
**made out of voxels.**

It aims to support vast render distances and destructibility, which sets it
apart from other engines. Written in *C++*, built with *OpenGL*, it's a
high-performance engine.

### Features

**CUBOS.** is structured around the \ref core-ecs "Entity Component System"
(ECS) pattern, which makes it very flexible and easy to extend. It also makes
it easy to parallelize the systems, since they have clearly defined
dependencies.

You can read more about how the engine is structured in \ref structure section.

### Getting started

In the \ref guides section you can find multiple guides on how to use the
engine and create your own game.
