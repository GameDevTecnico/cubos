# Engine {#engine}

The `engine` library includes the high-level functionality of the game engine.
It is built on top of the `core` library and provides the
\ref cubos::engine::Cubos "Cubos" class, which is the entry point of the
engine. It also includes plugins for use with this class, such as the
\ref cubos::engine::plugins::renderer "plugins::renderer" and the
\ref cubos::engine::plugins::collisions "plugins::collisions".

This section of the documentation is split into:
- \subpage engine-cubos - the main class of the engine;
- \subpage engine-plugins - list of plugins included in the engine;
