# Core {#core}

The `core` library includes essential functionality like serialization,
logging, render devices, input handling and others.

This section of the documentation covers how to use the `core` library
directly, although if you're developing a game you won't need to delve
deeply into some of the topics (for example, the
\ref cubos::core::gl::RenderDevice "gl::RenderDevice" class).

It is split into the following namespaces:
- \subpage core-memory - streams and memory utilities;
- \subpage core-data - file system and serialization;
- \subpage core-gl - render device, voxel and other graphics utilities;
- \subpage core-io - window management and input handling;
- \subpage core-ui - user interface utilities;
- \subpage core-ecs - entity-component-system framework;
