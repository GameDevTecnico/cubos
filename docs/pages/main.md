## Voxel based engine

**Cubos aims to be a simple, but powerful game engine for PC, where**
**everything is made out of voxels.**

It is [open source](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos) and free to use
for any purpose. Written in modern *C++* (20) and with data-oriented design in
mind, its goal is to be both performant and highly flexible.

### Getting started

The best way to get started is to read the @ref getting-started
"getting started guide", which will guide you through the process of
downloading and building the engine, as well as where to go from there.

There is also a @ref features "feature guide" which gives you a high-level
overview of the engine's design and features. If you're just looking for a
quick overview, this is the place to go. You can also take a look at the
[modules](modules.html) page, which describes each of the engine's modules.

In the @ref examples "examples page" you can find examples on how to use
specific parts of the engine.

Consider taking a look at the @ref exercises "exercises page" if you want some
challenges to help you understand how to work with **Cubos**.

If you're looking to contribute to the project, make sure you read the 
@ref contribution "contribution guidelines", which introduces you to the
project's conventions and code style.

### Team

**Cubos** is developed by a team at
[GameDev Técnico](https://www.instagram.com/gamedevtecnico/), a student group
at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) who make games.
Our goal is to build a game engine from the ground up and have fun doing it.
