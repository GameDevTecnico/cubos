# Examples {#examples}

@brief Contains examples of specific features of the libraries.

If you are just starting out, you should probably start by the engine examples.
These cover the actual user-facing features, and are a good place to get a feel
for how using the engine looks like, while the core examples are more directed
at engine developers trying to understand how specific low-level features are
used.
