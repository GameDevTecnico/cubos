# Systems {#core-ecs-systems}

A system is a logic that operates on the \subpage core-ecs-components data, let it be creating, destroying or changing. For example we can have a system that changes the velocity of a car, increasing it if the player presses the accelarator or decreasing it if the player presses the breaks.
